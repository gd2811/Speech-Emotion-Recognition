# Speech Emotion Recognition Project Summary

The "Speech Emotion Recognition" project is a Python-based application that aims to recognize emotions from speech audio data. It utilizes machine learning and signal processing techniques to analyze audio recordings and infer the emotional state of the speaker.

## Key Features

- **Audio Data Processing**: The project preprocesses audio data, extracting relevant features such as pitch, intensity, and spectral characteristics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: It employs machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks or support vector machines to classify emotions based on the extracted audio features.
- **Emotion Classification**: The application categorizes speech segments into different emotional states, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: It measures the performance of the emotion recognition system using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Collect audio recordings containing speech segments expressing various emotions.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the audio data to extract relevant features and prepare it for input to the machine learning models.
3. **Training**: Train the machine learning models using labeled audio data to learn the patterns associated with different emotions.
4. **Testing and Evaluation**: Test the trained models on new audio data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained models as part of an application or service for real-time emotion recognition from speech.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing, machine learning, and application development.
- **Librosa**: Python library for audio and music analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building classification models.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks for developing neural network models.
- **Matplotlib**: Python plotting library .
